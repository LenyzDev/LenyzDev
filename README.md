# WELCOME! 👋🏻
My name is Nycolas, I am currently 19 years old, I currently live in the interior of São Paulo, a big city in Brazil.
I started programming 8 years ago, using languages ​​such as JavaScript and Lua, but 4 years ago I fell in love with Java and have continued to do so until today.
My biggest inspiration to start programming was the desire to create Minecraft Servers. And today I own one.

## MINE WAY
This is the biggest project I've ever participated in my entire life.
A Minecraft server aimed at the Brazilian public, which has more than 45,000 members on discord.
In addition to more than 10,000,000 people who have already passed through our network!

## MINE ORIGIN
This is one of the big projects I intend to found at some point.
A server aimed at the global public, with translations and a monstrous infrastructure.
In addition to a lot of innovation!
