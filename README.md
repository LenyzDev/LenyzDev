# WELCOME! 👋🏻
My name is Nycolas, I am currently 20 years old, I currently live in the interior of São Paulo, a large city in Brazil.
I started programming 9 years ago, using languages ​​like JavaScript and Lua, but 6 years ago I fell in love with Java and continue to do so to this day.
My biggest inspiration to start programming was the desire to create Minecraft Servers. And today I own Lenyz Corporation, a company that creates Minecraft Servers and content for UGC Games.

## MINE ORIGIN
This is Lenyz Corporation's first major project, a Server with several innovations and a structure entirely made by us to obtain performance and playability.

## MINE WAY
This is the biggest project I've ever participated in my entire life.
A Minecraft server aimed at the Brazilian public, which has more than 50,000 members on discord.
In addition to more than 10,000,000 people who have already passed through our network!
